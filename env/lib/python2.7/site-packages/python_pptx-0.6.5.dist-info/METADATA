        *python-pptx* is a Python library for creating and updating PowerPoint (.pptx)
        files.
        
        A typical use would be generating a customized PowerPoint presentation from
        database content, downloadable by clicking a link in a web application.
        Several developers have used it to automate production of presentation-ready
        engineering status reports based on information held in their work management
        system. It could also be used for making bulk updates to a library of
        presentations or simply to automate the production of a slide or two that
        would be tedious to get right by hand.
        
        More information is available in the `python-pptx documentation`_.
        
        Browse `examples with screenshots`_ to get a quick idea what you can do with
        python-pptx.

        Release History
        ---------------
        
        0.6.5 (2017-03-21)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - #267 compensate for non-conforming PowerPoint behavior on c:overlay element
        
        - compensate for non-conforming (to spec) PowerPoint behavior related to
          c:dLbl/c:tx that results in "can't save" error when explicit data labels
          are added to bubbles on a bubble chart.
        
        
        0.6.4 (2017-03-17)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - add Chart.chart_title and ChartTitle object
        - #263 Use Number type to test for numeric category
        
        
        0.6.3 (2017-02-28)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - add DataLabel.font
        - add Axis.axis_title
        
        
        0.6.2 (2017-01-03)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - add support for NotesSlide (slide notes, aka. notes page)
        - add support for arbitrary series ordering in XML
        - add Plot.categories providing access to hierarchical categories in an
          existing chart.
        - add support for date axes on category charts, including writing a dateAx
          element for the category axis when ChartData categories are date or
          datetime.
        
        **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES:**
        
        Some changes were made to the boilerplate XML used to create new charts. This
        was done to more closely adhere to the settings PowerPoint uses when creating
        a chart using the UI. This may result in some appearance changes in charts
        after upgrading. In particular:
        
        * Chart.has_legend now defaults to True for Line charts.
        * Plot.vary_by_categories now defaults to False for Line charts.

        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Add support for creating and manipulating bar, column, line, and pie charts
        - Major refactoring of XML layer (oxml)
        - Rationalized graphical object shape access
          **Note backward incompatibilities below**
        
        **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES:**
        
        A table is no longer treated as a shape. Rather it is a graphical object
        contained in a GraphicFrame shape, as are Chart and SmartArt objects.
        
        Example::
        
            table = shapes.add_table(...)
        
            # becomes
        
            graphic_frame = shapes.add_table(...)
            table = graphic_frame.table
        
            # or
        
            table = shapes.add_table(...).table
        
        As the enclosing shape, the id, name, shape type, position, and size are
        attributes of the enclosing GraphicFrame object.
        
        The contents of a GraphicFrame shape can be identified using three available
        properties on a shape: has_table, has_chart, and has_smart_art. The enclosed
        graphical object is obtained using the properties GraphicFrame.table and
        GraphicFrame.chart. SmartArt is not yet supported. Accessing one of these
        properties on a GraphicFrame not containing the corresponding object raises
        an exception.

        ++++++++++++++++++

        **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES:**
        
        The following enumerations were moved/renamed during the rationalization of
        enumerations:
